Question # 04
Build a GPA calculator that inputs grades of 3 different subjects along with the credit hours
from the user and displays the userâ€™s GPA. The input grades and their corresponding grading
points are given below.
Grade Points
A 4.0
A- 3.67
B+ 3.33
B 3.0
B- 2.67
C+ 2.33
C 2.0
C- 1.67
D+ 1.33
D 1.0
F 0

The formula is
gpa = (gp1 * ch1 + gp2 * ch2 + gp3 * ch3)/ (ch1 + ch2 + ch3)
Where GP1 is Points of Subject 1 and CH1 show credit hours of subject 1.
