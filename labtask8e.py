print("1.Coffee 2.Tea 3.Coke 4.Orange juice")


while ask != -1:
    i += 1
    ask = int(input(f"Please input the favourite beverage of person #{i} choose 1,2,3 or 4 fom the above menu or -1 to exit the program \n"))
    if ask == 1:

        orange_juice += 1
               
print("Beverage             Number of votes")
print("#######################################")
