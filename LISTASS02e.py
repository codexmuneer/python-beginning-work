'''Write a program that computes the product of any two matrices entered by the user. Your
program should check if the two matrices are multipliable or not. In case of non-multipliable
matrices, the program should display a proper message and prompt the user to reinter matrices
with proper dimensions.
Note: Do not use built-in function for matrix multiplication'''
